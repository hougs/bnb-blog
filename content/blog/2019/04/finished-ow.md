I finished up my PADI Open Water certification. First off, SCUBA diving as an activity is incredible. Doing it well means being extremely relaxed and slow moving. Gently
floating up and down in the water with your breathing. Neutral buoyancy and easy
back flips are lovely but the mind boggling part is what you get to see under
the surface! Coral reefs are full of all kinds of things. Big creatures are fun.
Seeing a turtle chomp down on some hard coral is an impressive snack-sighting
and eagle rays gliding by with nothing but blue in the background is awesome.

I'm pretty obsessed with the corals, sponges, and reef structures themselves.
So many different kinds of corals, so many different colors. Purple *and* neon
green encrusting coral? Check. Soft, pink corals waving in the water? Check.
Green brain looking corals that I can't quite figure out where the polyps
are? Check. The huge vase shaped things are barrel sponges. Sponges!

Being underwater and floating around a reef is like being in an alien world.
The creatures are soo different. The topography and landmarks are strange. The biology
of how the plants, animals, and ecosystem works is bizarre. You're
floating and basically weightless. I'm extremely happy that I get to poke around
underwater and explore this healthy, beautiful reef.

Diving itself has it's risks. I decided to do my open water certification with
[Roatan Divers.](http://roatandivers.com/) Doing my research I found that
there are a ton of really well reviewed dive shops on the island. No one seems
to have ever had anything bad to say about Roatan Divers. I figured I may as well
not cut any corners when I'm trying to learn how to be safe under 18 m of water.
My instructors have been really great. I had Felix for my first day which was
mostly class time and one confined dive. The confined dives happen in the
protected waters of Half Moon Bay, in the middle of West End. You get to practice
some skills which help get you comfortable with equipment and potential mishaps.
Felix was great and I ended up running into him and his friends from Koh Tao,
Nikki and Matt, again and again in my first few days here.

For my last two days I had Vero as an instructor and Fletcher (a dive master in
training) helping out and practicing his dive master skills. Vero is awesome. I
learned a ton from her and she is super fun. She is moving to Indonesia soon -- so
that is getting ideas in my head about future fun places to travel and go diving.
Though, the currents are strong so I'll need to get more time in under the water.
Luckily I have  plenty of warm water plans in the next few months, and more
time here in Roatan. I'm having such a good time diving here and such a great time
with Roatan Diver's that I'm going to get my advanced open water certification
with them too. May as well get great instruction while I have the time and the
diving is great.

Thanks Vero, Felix, and Fletcher!
