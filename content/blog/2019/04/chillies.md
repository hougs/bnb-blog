I was just settling in to my low-key cabin, wondering how I'm going to sleep on this
unusually windless and hot night. Suddenly, the sky opened up with thunder,
lightening, and started dumping buckets. So, I guess I'll be sleeping to the
sound of a tropical rainstorm. I've been in a rustic cabin in the back of the property.
Pretty chill and quiet with the exception of the creepy, unpleasant dude I
was sharing the kitchen and bathroom with.

Why was this guy so unpleasant? Let me count the ways:

1) He started hitting on me immediately and would start doing shirtless pushups
any time I was around. Bleh.

2) He pocketed and brought back 'dead' corals from the reef.

3) He told me he was purposefully trying to aggravate sea life. "Well, you know,
I'm a boy and we want to touch everything we see." -- Him, as a stared at me.
BLEGGGHHHHHH.

4) He really, strongly encouraged me to admonish him a lot and sternly for
being too loud in the cabin. I really don't need to know a stranger's kinks like that.

5) He was pretty consistently condescending and racists toward Hondurans.

Aaaaaanyway, he is gone now and I'm a lot happier.

The location of Hotel Chillies is pretty perfect but the icing on the cake is
the small food stand out front called Yahongreh. They make awesome baleadas, which
are a new favorite food of mine.

# Baleada
Baleadas are a perfect food. First of all, they are just the right size for me when
** want a filling meal. Second, I'm never mad about fresh tortillas.

## Ingredients:
- Freshly made, thick flour tortilla
- Refried beans
- Whatever else you want inside, probably avocado

## Directions:

1) Make a flour tortilla

2) Add a thin layer of refried beans

3) Put other stuff inside

4) Wish you were at Yahongreh because their's are better.
