I'm kicking off my trip by decompressing, and then recompressing, over and
over again. It is my 4th day on the island and I'm in the middle of my PADI
Open Water certification course at Roatan Divers. Yesterday afternoon I got to
do my first open water dive. Meaning, actually get out to a dive site and get
down there. What a sight! I've never seen a reef like this. Enormous, healthy,
and full of all kinds of life. Everything was amazing and two sea turtles
(a green sea turtle and a hornsbill) came out to say 'Hello!'

In the evenings I've been hanging out near the water, drinking beer, and
chatting with approximately everyone I could grab an ear from. After my first
day of the SCUBA course I went over to Ginger's to have a beer and ended up
talking with my instructor's girlfriend and waitress at Ginger's, Rosie, for a
while. Eventually Felix and some of his friends he knows from Koh Tao
(Nikki and Matt) show up and I end up getting quite a few good stories from them.
Last night I went across the street to meet up with some friends I made on the
plane and ended up running into Felix's birthday party, including everyone from
the dive shop and Nikki and Matt. I ended up having already met about a 1/3 of
the bar. Gosh I love talking to strangers.
