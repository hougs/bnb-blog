I'm kicking off my trip by decompressing, and then recompressing, over and
over again. It is my 4th day on the island and I'm in the middle of my PADI
Open Water certification course at Roatan Divers. My first open water dive blew
my mind. I've never seen a reef like this. Enormous, healthy,
and full of all kinds of life. Everything was amazing and two sea turtles
(a green sea turtle and a hornsbill) came out to say 'Hello!' Yesterday I finished
up the theory portion of the class. Swiming out to do my last confined dive,
in the shallow Half Moon Bay in West End we saw an Eagle Ray. In the afternoon
I got to

In the evenings I've been hanging out near the water, drinking beer, and
chatting with approximately everyone I could grab an ear from. After my first
day of the SCUBA course I went over to Ginger's to have a beer and ended up
talking with my instructor's girlfriend and waitress at Ginger's, Rosie, for a
while. Eventually Felix and some of his friends he knows from Koh Tao
(Nikki and Matt) show up and I end up getting quite a few good stories from them.
Last night I went across the street to meet up with some friends I made on the
plane and ended up running into Felix's birthday party, including everyone from
the dive shop and Nikki and Matt. I ended up having already met about a 1/3 of
the bar. Gosh I love talking to strangers.
